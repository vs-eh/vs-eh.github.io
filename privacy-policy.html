                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">This privacy policy applies only to the websites controlled by Citizen Awareness Project, Inc. and/or its subsidiary and affiliated entities ("CAP," "we," or "us") where this privacy policy is posted (collectively, the "Sites"). This privacy policy does not pertain to information that is collected offline. BY USING THE SITES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TO OUR PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITES. </p>
                    
                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>A. Information Collected</strong></p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">This privacy policy applies only to information collected on the Sites and does not apply to information collected by CAP through any other means. This website does not target or collect information from children under the age of 13. </p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">We collect two types of information from visitors to the Sites: (1) Personally Identifiable Information; and (2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address or cookies.</p> 

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name. CAP collects and stores the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us. Here are some examples of manners in which we may collect your personally identifiable information on the Sites:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li class="text-muted">   We may collect your email address, first and last name, physical address, and other volunteered information if you sign up to receive updates or to volunteer to support CAP; </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   We may collect your social networking profile information and information regarding your friends or followers if you connect your social networking profile to the Sites or otherwise provide us permission to access such information;</li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   We may collect your name and email address if you contact us with a question;</li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   We may collect your first and last name, date of birth, address, telephone number, email address, and other volunteered information if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes; and </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   We may collect your first and last name, your occupation and employer name, your mailing/billing address, your phone number, your e-mail address, and your credit card and billing information if you choose to make a contribution to CAP. </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">The above list provides an example of the personally identifiable information that may be collected on the Sites. If you do not want CAP to collect your personally identifiable information, please do not provide it to us.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">"Non-Personally Identifiable Information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the Sites and a description of how this information is used:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li class="text-muted">    Internet Protocol (IP) address -- Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the webpages you view. We use this information to deliver our webpages to you upon request, to tailor our Sites to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our Sites. </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">    Cookie -- A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Sites. For example, when someone visits a page within the Sites, a cookie is placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Sites previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Sites. Some of the cookies we use may be flash cookies or Adobe cookies. While they are harmless, they may contain Demographic Information (defined below) and depending on your browser these cookies may not normally be deleted when your cookies are deleted. Please check your browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how they may be deleted. </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">    Web Beacons (also known as "clear gifs," "web bugs" or "pixel tags") -- "Web Beacons" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages. </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">    Demographic Information -- "Demographic Information" may be your gender, age, zip code and interests, which you voluntarily provide to us on the Sites through voluntary surveys and otherwise. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable information. </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">    General Site Traffic – All traffic on the Sites is recorded to provide needed information to properly size and maintain the Sites.  This ensures fast and efficient navigation of the Sites and their contents to enhance your experience.</li>
                    </ul>  
                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">We collect the above non-personally identifiable information from all visitors to our Sites. If you do not want CAP to have access to this information, please do not visit our Sites.</p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>B. Use of Information Collected Via the Sites</strong></p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">We use your personally identifiable information that is collected on these Sites primarily for the following purposes:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li class="text-muted">   To deliver services, such as information or newsletters you request;</li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   To alert you to upcoming events, special offers and to forward promotional materials;</li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   To remind you to vote;</li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   To contact you as a result of a Federal Election Committee (“FEC”) or Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) requirement or as otherwise required by law;</li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   To compile data that was collected as part of an online survey or petition;</li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   To complete a transaction or service requested by you; </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   To fulfill the terms of a promotion, contest or sweepstakes; </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   To help us create and publish content most relevant to you;</li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   To monitor and analyze usage of our Sites;</li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   To notify you about a material change to this privacy policy or any other agreement posted to our Sites, if necessary; 
                    <li class="text-muted">   To share with other organizations that share our cause, including the Republican National Committee, the Republican candidate, and others;</li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   To contact you in response to sign up forms such as “Contact Us,” Volunteer Sign-Up forms, or Event Requests; and</li>
                    <li class="text-muted">   For any other purpose for which we notify you that the information is collected.</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">Non-personally identifiable information is used as described above and in other ways as permitted by applicable laws, including combining non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information (except with respect to non-personally identifiable information collected from children under the age of 13, which we do not knowingly collect).

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>C. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</strong></p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">We may share or disclose your personally identifiable information in the following instances:</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                    <li class="text-muted"> To fulfill a service to you. For example, from time to time, our newsletters, updates or content may be delivered by third parties performing a service for us.  Similarly, if you email us a question or request, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question.  Also, if you are entering a promotion, sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion, sweepstakes, or contest.  This means that we may share the information for prize fulfillment purposes or with mail carriers.  We also may share your information with the co-sponsor of any promotion, sweepstakes or contest. </li>

                    <li class="text-muted"> To affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers, or other unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we believe may be of interest to you or who require your personally identifiable information for research, administrative and/or internal business purposes. These parties may use your personally identifiable information to contact you with an offer or advertisement related to a product or service, or they may use such information for their own research, administration or business purposes. If you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information in this manner, please do not provide us with this information. </li>

                    <li class="text-muted"> To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our Sites and provide other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, order processing and fulfillment, contribution processing purposes, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on CAP's behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other promotions). We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personally identifiable information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us administer our Sites will have access to users' personally identifiable information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit any personally identifiable information to us. </li>

                    <li class="text-muted"> To complete your contribution. If you choose to make a contribution on the Sites, we may collect from you your credit card number, billing address and other information related to such purchase, and we may use such collected information in order to fulfill your contribution. We may also provide such information, or other personally identifiable information provided by you, to unaffiliated third parties as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card). </li>

                    <li class="text-muted"> To comply with requirements of the FEC, which mandate that we use our best efforts to collect and disclose the name, mailing address, occupation, and employer of individuals that submit donations in excess of $200 in a calendar year.  Additional information about this requirement is available on the FEC website, located at www.fec.gov. </li>

                    <li class="text-muted"> To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of CAP and its family of Sites or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users. </li>

                    <li class="text-muted"> To third parties as part of any reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets, or as part of a finance or lending transaction.</li>

                    <li class="text-muted"> To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties. </li>

                    <li class="text-muted"> To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information collected from these Sites. In the course of such verification, we may receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.</li>
                </ol>
                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">Except as described in this privacy policy or at the time we request the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to any third parties.</p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p> 

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">We use non-personally identifiable information collected on the Sites in the manner disclosed above, in the Section A (2). We may share this non-personal information with third parties.</p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>D. Email Communications</strong></p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">We communicate with individuals on a regular basis via email.  For example, we may use your email address to confirm your request, to send you notice of payments, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.</p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">However, we provide you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of communication from us, such as emails or updates from us regarding CAP and CAP events, products offered on the Sites, requests for donations, or if you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information with third parties. The opt-out choice may be exercised by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within the text of the email or by contacting us and notifying us that you would like to opt-out.  We will process your unsubscribe as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some circumstances you may receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe is processed.</p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>E. Forums, Chat Rooms and Other Public Posting Areas</strong></p> 
                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">Please note that any information you include in a message you post to any chat room, forum or other public posting area, as well as your signature on any public online petition, is available to anyone with Internet access. If you don't want people to know your e-mail address, for example, don't include it in any message you post publicly. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND IN OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN PUBLIC POSTING AREAS.</p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>F. Third Party Web Sites </strong></p>
                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">This statement applies solely to information collected on the Sites. The Sites may contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other web sites.</p> 

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>G. Assignment </strong></p>
                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">In the event that all or part of our assets or sold or acquired by another party, or in the event of a merger, you grant us the right to assign the personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information collected via the Sites.</p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>H. Changes to this Privacy Policy </strong></p>
                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we will also revise the "last update" date at the bottom of this privacy policy. For changes to this privacy policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on the Sites.</p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>I. Security </strong></p>
                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you understand that any information that you transfer to CAP is done at your own risk.</p> 

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using these Sites or providing personally identifiable information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of these Sites. We may post a notice on our Sites if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>

                    <p class="section-policy text-highlighted"><strong>J. Contacting CAP </strong></p>
                    <p class="section-policy text-muted">If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our privacy practices, please contact us using the “Contact Us” feature on the Sites, or by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@citizenawarenessproject.org">info@citizenawarenessproject.org</a>. All information you provide in any written communication will also be covered by this policy. </p>
